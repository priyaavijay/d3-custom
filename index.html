            <strong>Marks and Channels</strong><br>This visualization displays the global distribution of top Instagram influencers, represented by colored and sized bubbles. 
            Each country is color-coded based on the normalized average influence score of its influencers, while individual influencers 
            are shown as circles positioned around their respective countries when the country is clicked. The size of each circle reflects the influence score, 
            the color intensity reflects follower count and the thickness of their borders reflect the number of posts they have made on instagram. 
            Users can click on a country to zoom in and examine influencer details within that country 
            and click anywhere else on the globe to zoom out of it.
